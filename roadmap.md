set up deployable nodes to incentivize creation of system

use postgres/sequelize instead of firebase

only pay with bitcoin
part of payment goes to server costs, route through own node, take off a flat amount
10 cents per transaction for example

p2p, driver, passenger

give suggested price based on location
upload heat map of traffic dense areas for formula and time
